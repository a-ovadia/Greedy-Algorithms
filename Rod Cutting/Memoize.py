def maxRevenueMemoize(length, sizes, prices):
    """
    Calculate the maximum revenue from cutting a rod using dynamic programming with memoization.

    This function solves the rod cutting problem efficiently by using a bottom-up approach
    and a memoization table to store intermediate results.

    Args:
    length (int): The total length of the rod to be cut.
    sizes (list of int): A list of possible cut sizes.
    prices (list of float): A list of prices corresponding to each cut size.

    Returns:
    float: The maximum revenue that can be obtained from cutting the rod.

    Time Complexity: O(n * m), where n is the length of the rod and m is the number of possible cut sizes.
    Space Complexity: O(n) for the memoization table.

    Note:
    - This function assumes that the lengths of 'sizes' and 'prices' lists are equal.
    - The function considers the option of not cutting a piece (waste) by appending 0 to optionValues.

    Example:
    >>> L = 5
    >>> sizes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> prices = [2, 5, 7, 8, 10]
    >>> maxRevenueMemoize(L, sizes, prices)
